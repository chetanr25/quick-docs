# Quick Docs - Intelligent Document Manager

Quick Docs is a cross-platform **document manager** that helps you **organize, search, and instantly access** files across devices.  
Whether it‚Äôs PDFs, Word docs, or text files. Quick Docs makes them **searchable**, **synced**, and **accessible anytime**, **anywhere**.  

Unlike traditional apps that only search by filename, **Quick Docs** goes deeper. It **extracts text, tokenizes content, and powers a ‚ÄúMagic Search‚Äù** that can find any document by just a hint. Forgot the file name? No problem. Quick Docs will map the word, phrase, or token you remember and instantly retrieve the right document.  

With **cloud sync, realtime updates, and offline file support**, Quick Docs bridges the gap between **convenience** and **reliability**. From lecture notes to contracts to casual WhatsApp PDFs, your documents are always at your fingertips.

## üõ† Technical Overview

### Architecture
- **Frontend (Flutter/Dart)**: UI, auth, client logic  
- **Backend (FastAPI)**: uploads, text extraction, tokenization  
- **Azure Blob Storage**: file storage  
- **Firebase Firestore**: realtime metadata & search  

### Data Flow
1. User selects file in app  
2. App uploads to FastAPI (sync or async)  
3. Backend stores file (Azure), extracts text, tokenizes  
4. Backend returns structured result (file URL, tokens, metadata)  
5. App saves result to Firestore ‚Üí UI updates in realtime  

### Backend Highlights
- FastAPI + Uvicorn  
- Azure Storage SDK (Blob)  
- PyPDF2, python-docx  
- Optional spaCy for NLP  
- Health endpoint for liveness checks  

### Flutter app Highlights
- Firebase Auth & Firestore integration  
- In-app PDF viewer with caching mechanism
- Robust upload client with validation & error handling  
- API URL service with health-check & caching  

### Cloud Components
- **Azure App Service** - deploy backend  
- **Azure Blob Storage** - persist files  
- **Firebase** - auth + realtime data  

---

## üìÇ Supported Files & Limits
- **File types:** PDF, DOCX, TXT (legacy DOC partial support)  
- **Async Upload:** Leveraging FastAPI, the app supports asynchronous upload and processing for better scalable and fast response solution

---

## üì± Platform Support
- Android  
- iOS  
- Web (Flutter)

- Real-time updates across devices  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (High Level)
- **Backend:** `.env` for Azure credentials and container settings  
- **App:** `API_BASE_URL` via `.env` or SharedPreferences (auto health-checks + Firestore fallback)  
- **Firebase:** Auth + Firestore configured per environment  

---

## üîí Security & Privacy
- Authentication via Firebase  
- Scoped per-user data in Firestore (rules enforced)  
- Files stored securely in Azure Blob Storage  
- Secrets managed via environment variables (not bundled in app)  

---

## ‚ö° Performance & Reliability
- Async processing for large files  
- Cached API base URL with runtime health checks  
- Stream-based Firestore UI updates  
- Local caching for offline PDF viewing
